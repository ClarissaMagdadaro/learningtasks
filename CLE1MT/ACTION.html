    <h1><b> ACTION </b></h1>
        <p>Cancel culture or call-out culture is a contemporary phrase used to refer to a form of ostracism in which someone is thrust out of social or professional circles – whether it be online, on social media, or in person.Those subject to this ostracism are said to have been "canceled".The expression "cancel culture" has mostly negative connotations and is used in debates on free speech and censorship. </p>

        <p>The notion of cancel culture is a variant of the term call-out culture. It is often said to take the form of boycotting or shunning an individual (often a celebrity) who is deemed to have acted or spoken in an unacceptable manner. 
        Some critics argue that cancel culture has a chilling effect on public discourse. Others argue that calls for "cancellation" are themselves a form of free speech and that they promote accountability. Some public figures claim to have been "canceled" while continuing their careers as before. </p>
        
        <p>Within the turbulent past few years, the idea that a person can be “canceled” — in other words, culturally blocked from having a prominent public platform or career — has become a polarizing topic of debate. The rise of “cancel culture” and the idea of canceling someone coincides with a familiar pattern: A celebrity or other public figure does or says something offensive. A public backlash, often fueled by politically progressive social media, ensues.</p>
        

        <p>Then come the calls to cancel the person — that is, to effectively end their career or revoke their cultural cachet, whether through boycotts of their work or disciplinary action from an employer.To many people, this process of publicly calling for accountability, and boycotting if nothing else seems to work, has become an important tool of social justice — a way of combatting, through collective action, some of the huge power imbalances that often exist between public figures with far-reaching platforms and audiences, and the people and communities their words and actions may harm. </p>
        

        <p>But conservative politicians and pundits have increasingly embraced the argument that canceling culture, rather than being a way of speaking truth to power, has spun out of control and become a senseless form of social media mob rule. At the 2020 Republican National Convention, for example, numerous speakers, including President Trump, addressed cancel culture directly, and one delegate resolution even explicitly targeted the phenomenon, describing it as having “grown into erasing of history, encouraging lawlessness, muting citizens, and violating free exchange of ideas, thoughts, and speech.”</p>
        

        <p>Actually ending someone’s career through the power of public backlash is difficult. Few entertainers or other public figures have truly been canceled — that is, while they may have faced considerable negative criticism and calls to be held accountable for their statements and actions, very few of them have truly experienced career-ending repercussions.</p>

        <p>Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling, for example, has faced intense criticism from her own fans since she began to voice transphobic beliefs, making her one of the most prominently “canceled” individuals at the center of the cancel culture debate. But following Rowling’s publication, in June 2020, of a transphobic manifesto, sales of the author’s books actually increased tremendously in her home country of Great Britain.</p>
        
        <p>“Canceling” came out of the unlikeliest place: a misogynistic joke</p>
         
        <p>Given how frequently it’s been used to repudiate sexism and misogyny, it’s ironic that the concept of “canceling” shares its DNA with a misogynistic joke. One of the first references to canceling someone comes in the 1991 film New Jack City, in which Wesley Snipes plays a gangster named Nino Brown. In one scene, after his girlfriend breaks down because of all the violence he’s causing, he dumps her by saying, “Cancel that bitch. I’ll buy another one.” (We reportedly owe this witticism to screenwriter Barry Michael Cooper.)</p>
        
       <p>Jump to 2010, when Lil Wayne referenced the film in a line from his song “I’m Single”: “Yeah, I’m single / n***a had to cancel that bitch like Nino.” This callback to the earlier sexist cancel joke probably helped the phrase percolate for a while.
           But canceling seems to have gotten its first big boost into the zeitgeist from an episode of VH1’s reality show Love and Hip-Hop: New York that aired in December 2014, in which cast member Cisco Rosado tells his love interest Diamond Strawberry during a fight, “you’re canceled.” Even with zero context, it’s a hilarious moment: 
           
           <li><a href="https://youtu.be/SAhaHP9OTeM">Love and Hip Hop: New York (Season 5)</a></li>
           <li><a href="https://twitter.com/renzoracks_/status/547206874148663296?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E547206874148663296%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vox.com%2Fculture%2F2019%2F12%2F30%2F20879720%2Fwhat-is-cancel-culture-explained-history-debate ">The quote began to appear on social media shortly after the episode aired.</a></li>
           
        <p>From there, the idea of canceling began to spread via Black Twitter throughout 2015, used as a reaction to someone doing something you disapproved of — either jokingly or seriously. As it caught on, however, the term began to evolve into a way of responding not just to friends or acquaintances, but also to celebrities or entities whose behavior offended you.</p>
        
        
       <h1>Influences From Black Culture</h1> 
        

        <p>While public shaming and silencing are practices that have been around as long as society itself, cancel culture is a somewhat new concept with specific ties to Black culture.According to the news site Vox, the first reference of canceling a person in pop culture possibly comes from the 1991 movie New Jack City, when Wesley Snipes’ character, Nino Brown, says, “Cancel that [woman]. I’ll buy another one,” referencing his girlfriend’s disapproval of his violent ways. In 2010, rapper Lil Wayne referenced the quote in his song “I’m Single.” But it was after a 2014 Love H and ip-Hop: New York episode when cast member Cisco Rosado told his love interest “You’re canceled,” that the term gained traction on social media. Soon after, Black Twitter began using it both jokingly and seriously to express their disagreement with others.</p>
        

        <p>“There are also these series of practices on Twitter, some of which have come from Black Twitter, of skilled insults, which come from the Dozens, a game common in Black communities of finding clever ways to put someone down,” Stanfill says. And while cancel culture’s origins are linked to playful banter, it also stems from one form of protest: boycotting. Started by the Irish in the 1880s, boycotting became a powerful social and political tool used successfully by African Americans during the civil rights movement, such as the Montgomery bus boycott sparked by Rosa Parks.</p>
        

        <p>“If you don’t have the ability to stop something through political means, what you can do is refuse to participate,” said Anne Charity Hudley — North Hall Endowed Chair in the Linguistics of African America at the University of California, Santa Barbara — in the same Vox article. “Canceling is a way to acknowledge that you don’t have to have the power to change structural inequality. You don’t even have to have the power to change all of public sentiment. But as an individual, you can still have power beyond measure.”</p>


        <p>The internet heightens that power by collectively amplifying the voices of marginalized people who may be a minority — and otherwise silenced — in their physical communities. It’s also allowed others to become aware and support them as allies.Since #BlackLivesMatter began in 2014 after George Zimmerman was acquitted for killing Trayvon Martin, the hashtag has grown into a historic global movement. For decades, Black communities have spoken out about racial injustices and police brutality, but social media has bolstered attention around these issues and seriously shifted the nation’s recognition of the need for change — especially after the death of George Floyd. Social media’s public access has also allowed this form of public shaming to become a practice for people of all backgrounds to address varying issues.</p>
        
        <h1>Public Shaming Throughout Human History</h1>
        

        <p>A core element of cancel culture, public shaming has been used since societies were first formed. Stocks, or public restraints, were used in medieval Europe up through Colonial America, where Puritans used them to punish criminals. Tarring and feathering was also a form of public corporal punishment used to keep people in line. And during World War II, French women who were deemed traitors had their heads shaved, says Stacey (Barreto) DiLiberto ’03 ’11PhD, a UCF lecturer in philosophy. Though often tied to personal punishment, public shaming has also been understood to be a positive social practice.</p>
        

        <p>“Public shaming is a long-standing public ritual that helped to uphold social bonds and make sure people within communities were equal and understood the norms, and to ensure no one got too high and mighty,” says Amanda Koontz, UCF associate professor of sociology.One common example, Koontz notes, comes from the !Kung people, a band society — the simplest known form of society — in southern Africa. During Christmas 1969, Canadian anthropologist Robert Borshay Lee presented the group with a large ox as a gift. Members made fun of his offering and called it a “bag of bones,” and it was later explained that this “shaming of the meat” practice was standard to keep someone humble whenever they brought back a large kill.</p>

<h2>“-We have a tendency sometimes to say things via social media or other platforms that maybe we wouldn’t say if we were face to face with someone.”</h2>
        
        <p>This type of equalizing is understood to be a positive practice as the !Kung’s strong communal bonds have not been disrupted by the complex issues of modern societies, such as racism, sexism and political polarization. The in-person practice among people you know and live with also doesn’t translate to the scale of the global internet community, where often you’re ultimately engaging with strangers.</p>

        <p>Celebrities have always been highly susceptible to public criticism because of the nature of their privileged position. But in the era of cancel culture, they’re even more susceptible because they’re often viewed as agents of change, Koontz says. The #MeToo movement is one example of how publicly calling out powerful individuals can lead to a widespread cultural shift. When sexual abuse allegations against former film producer Harvey Weinstein became public in 2017, it led to his conviction as a sex offender. Other influential people have faced their own reckonings for similar misconducts, and societal attitudes toward sexism and sexual harassment are becoming more intolerant.</p>
        

        <p>But sometimes, public denouncement of powerful individuals can have the opposite effect of what is intended. When the Surviving R. Kelly docuseries premiered in January 2019, #MuteRKelly began trending, calling for the singer’s conviction for sexual crimes and an end to his career. But the increased negative attention around the artist seemed to backfire as on-demand streams for his music increased from 1.9 million the day before the docuseries began airing to 4.3 million — a 126 percent increase — on the day after the three-day premiere concluded.</p>
        

        <p>“The general public seems to have this power to hold accountable people who we’ve historically deemed powerful entities, but is that authority ultimately fleeting?” DiLiberto asks. “Yes, celebrities are real people too, and they say stupid things and do reprehensible things as well. But why should we care so much about what they do, as opposed to our own actions or our immediate community around us?”</p>
