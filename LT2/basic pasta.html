            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <p> 
                <br> Dried pasta or any works well.
                <br> Water
                <br> Salt
                <br> Tomato Pure
                <br> Cheese/Tuna/Both/None
            
            <h2>Method</h2>
            <p> 1. Boil your pasta adding salt to the water for later on.
         <br> 2. While pasta is cooking grate your cheese/drain your tuna.
        <br> 3.	When the pasta is cooked add about half a tube of tomato puree, stirring well, to give you a passata consistency. Of course you can just use passata if you want, and drain the pasta instead.
        <br> 4.	Then, add the tuna if using any, stirring it in well. Leave for a minute to heat up the tuna. Add salt/pepper to taste.
        <br> 5.	Serve into a bowl and sprinkle lots of cheese on top. ENJOY!

<p> This can be enjoyed as a simple tomato pasta, or with cheese or tuna, or both </p>
