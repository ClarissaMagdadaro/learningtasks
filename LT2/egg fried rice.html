                         This was one of the first easy recipes I learnt to cook and can be mastered in just a few attempts!<br> Itâ€™s healthy, cheap and tasty and makes the ultimate student food.</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <p> 
                <br> Rice (as much as you fancy really!)
                <br> Half an onion (or more,again if you fancy it!)
                <br> A tin of sweetcorn
                <br> A few mushrooms
                <br> 1-2 eggs (add more if you want)
                
            
            <h2>Method</h2>
            <p> 1. Start cooking the rice however you do, and put some oil in a frying pan.
         <br> 2. Chop the onion into bits, any size really, doesn't matter particularly and throw into the frying pan.
        <br> 3. Chop the mushrooms and add to the onions.
        <br> 4. Once the rice is cooked, drain it off and add intro the frying pan.
        <br> 5. Tip the drained sweetcorn into the pan as well and stir it all up.
        <br> 6. Break the eggs into the pan (OR beat them together in another bowl and tip into the frying pan) and stir the mixture up.
        </p>
<p> At this point, you need to keep stirring the mixture, keep the eggs moving. Keep going until the eggs have cooked, should take about 5-8 minutes maybe?</p>
