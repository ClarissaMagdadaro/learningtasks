This was one of the first easy recipes I learnt to cook and can be mastered in just a few attempts!</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <p> 
                <br> 3 Eggs
                <br> Salt and Pepper
                <br> Butter
                <br> Grated cheese (optional)
                <br> Mixed herbs (optional)
                
            
            <h2>Method</h2>
            <p> 1. Mix the eggs in any sort of bowl or jug you like (a pint glass works well!) with salt,pepper, and herbs if desired.
         <br> 2. Heat the butter (or oil) in a reasonably large frying pan.
        <br> 3. Pour in the egg mixture slowly and swirl the pan a little to even it out.
        <br> 4. After 30 seconds or so the top should firm up, at this point add grated cheese if you like.
        <br> 5. Continue cooking a little until the cheese begins to melt, then fold the omelette in half with a bendy spatula.
        <br> 6. If its nice and cooked on the bottom already then serve, otherwise, continue cooking on each side a little more! </p>
<p> Sometimes I make an omelette with loads of onions,chopped sausages and vegetables in. If you do this then you probably wont be able to fold it so instead, pop the pan under a grill to finish the top off after its cooked underneath. </p>
